# Guess the Number

Welcome to the **Guess the Number** project! This fun and interactive website challenges users to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. It's a great example of implementing logic and interactivity with basic web development skills.

## Website Link

Check out the live demo here: [Guess the Number](https://gussenumber1-100.netlify.app/)

## Features

- Generate a random number between 1 and 100.
- Allow users to input their guesses.
- Provide feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- Interactive and user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used

This project is built using the following technologies:

- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout of the elements.
- **JavaScript**: Logic to generate random numbers and evaluate user guesses.

## How It Works

1. The webpage prompts users to guess a number between 1 and 100.
2. Users input their guess into a field and click a button to submit it.
3. JavaScript compares the input with the generated number and provides feedback:
   - "Too high"
   - "Too low"
   - "Correct!"
4. Users can continue guessing until they find the correct number.
